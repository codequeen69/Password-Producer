# Password Producer

## Purpose
For this project, I wanted to create a password generator that would aid users in creating random passwords for their user accounts. I allowed users to choose if they wanted to use lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters, or a combination. Once that information was collected, a randomized password would be generated for use.
